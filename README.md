# Gadgetbridge_artikcloud

The repo is dedicated for the developement of a app that would allow mi-band to connect to a android app and connect itself to artik cloud. This would allows to exchange data to artik cloud, trigger events or monitor events on the band. 

[GadgetBridge](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=nodomain.freeyourgadget.gadgetbridge) is an open source app that allows fitness bands like the Mi-band,Mi-band 2 and pebble bands to connect to it and exchange activity data. Instead of using closed vendor applications that do not allow developers to tweak in, one can use this app for customised app developement. 

[Artik CLoud](https://artik.cloud/) is samsung's IOT cloud platfrom that allows IOT devices from different vendors to connect to a single platfrom and exchange data to be logged or trigger other activites.
